## manysql-client Docker image!

What I've included: mysql client, psql client, sqlite3, pip, and alembic. I chose these as they're most common, all work with Alembic, and because I didn't want TOO huge of an image.
Adding more clients is easy, simply update the `apk add` command on line 4 of the Dockerfile.

### How to use

Run the desired command immediately after the image name in `docker run` syntax.

Hiding the `docker run` commands in a shell/python script would be even better. That's on my TODO list.

For now, here are some examples:

```
jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸŒˆ6â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client mysql --version
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.26-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1

jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸŒˆ0â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.6.5

jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸŒˆ4â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client sqlite --version
3.20.1 2017-08-24 16:21:36 8d3a7ea6c5690d6b7c3767558f4f01b511c55463e3f9e64506801fe9b74dce34

jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸŒˆ8â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client pip --version
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)

jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸ”¥2â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client alembic --version
usage: alembic [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-n NAME] [-x X] [--raiseerr]
               {branches,current,downgrade,edit,heads,history,init,list_templates,merge,revision,show,stamp,upgrade}
```

I've included Bash in the image if any other fancy work needs to be done; or for
general basic inspection of the image (since it does not persist).

You may also chain together commands by passing them through Bash.
Bash could also be used to investigate the container's insides in a pinch if file structure is not immediately clear from build step.

```
jambii@patience ~/docker/manysql-client (master)
 ðŸŒˆ5â¤³ sudo docker run manysql-client bash -c "mysql --version && psql --version && alembic upgrade"
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.26-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.6.5
usage: alembic upgrade [-h] [--sql] [--tag TAG] revision
alembic upgrade: error: too few arguments
```

#### Use cases:

- Preforming remote upgrades/hotfixes/actions on-the-go, as part of a deploy, build, or maintenance process

- Executing remote queries on a machine where only Docker is installed, and installing other clients are not possible
